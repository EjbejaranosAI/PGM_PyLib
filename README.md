PGM PyLib: A Python Library for Inference and Learning of Probabilistic Graphical Models


The Probabilistic Graphical Models Python Library (PGM PyLib) was written in Python for
inference and learning of several classes of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM). 
The theory behind the different algorithms can be found in the book "Probabilistic 
Graphical Models Principles and Applications" of Luis Enrique Sucar.

The "PGM_PyLib Manual vX.X.pdf" contains the description of the PGM's which were implemented,
also you will find different examples.

If you use the library please cite the manual and the book.
